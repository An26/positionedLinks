# Rick and Morty Alerts!

###Welcome to my very very simple application where you can click or tab over to either Rick's or Morty's head to see what they say. 

### This application was mainly practice with HTML and CSS. Working with position relative and absolute was somewhat challenging when trying to append links to a dynamically centering image. 

##Solution

###  I ended up making my image a background image that was dynamically centered using the background properties. Then I created another div with the same width and height as my background image that was positioned absolute in the center of my screen with fixed margins. The links were also positioned absolutly as well. 

### Hope you all enjoy! :)
